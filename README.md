## Features

* **Multi-Band Support**: Calculation and rendering for 4-band, 5-band, and 6-band (PPM) resistors.
* **Industrial Label Generation**: Generates 1600x300 resolution labels including:
    * Resistance value with auto-prefixing (Ω, kΩ, MΩ, GΩ).
    * Multiplier.
    * Tolerance percentage.
    * Wattage rating.
    * Temperature coefficient (PPM) for 6-band components.
* **Export to PNG**: Optimized for physical labeling and component storage documentation.

## 🛠️ Project Structure

* `resistor_app.py`: The main entry point. Handles the Tkinter GUI and user interaction.
* `renderer.py`: The graphics engine.
* `resistor_data.py`: Contains all color dictionaries.
* `font/`: Contains `osifont.ttf`.

## Sample Outputs

Below are examples of the labels generated by the tool, showcasing different resistance and band configurations:
